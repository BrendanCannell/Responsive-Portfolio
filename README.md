# Responsive-Portfolio

I started off using the source files from the Basic Portfolio project as suggested, but I wound up adapting the Bootstrap Portfolio project instead.

I wanted to target the exact range of screen sizes that each style applied to rather than use the cascade to override previous styles. For that reason, and to avoid repeating myself, I ultimately used seven media queries instead of just three.
